# Using -slim (Debian/glibc) rather than -alpine (musl): the `formulas`
# library pulls in numpy and scipy, which publish pre-built wheels only
# for glibc. On Alpine these compile from source and need ~400MB of
# build tools (gcc, gfortran, musl-dev, linux-headers); on slim the
# wheels install directly with no build step, yielding faster builds
# and a smaller final image.
