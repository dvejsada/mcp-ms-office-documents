## Project Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server built with **FastMCP 3.0** that exposes Office document generation as MCP tools. Runs as a Docker container (Python 3.12, Alpine) on port **8958** at `/mcp` using streamable-HTTP transport. Entry point: `main.py`.

```

**Data flow:** Every tool converts input → in-memory bytes → calls `upload_file(file_obj, suffix)` → backend saves/uploads → returns URL or path string to the MCP client.

The **XLSX tool** has an extra recalculation pass between workbook save and upload: after `openpyxl` writes the file (with empty `<v>` tags for formula cells), `xlsx_tools/formula_engine.py` evaluates every formula in-process via the pure-Python `formulas` library, and `xlsx_tools/xml_cache.py` walks the worksheet XML to replace the empty `<v>` tags with the computed values. This makes the file preview correctly in tools that don't recalculate on open (Google Sheets preview, mail clients, openpyxl loaded with `data_only=True`). Controlled by `XLSX_RECALC_ENABLED` / the `recalc` tool parameter.

## Key Conventions

- **Config is centralized in `config.py`** — no module reads `os.environ` directly. Access via `get_config()` singleton.
- **Template resolution** (`template_utils.py`): searches `custom_templates/` before `default_templates/`, with `/app/*` container paths tried first, then local paths. Never hardcode template paths.
- **Dynamic tool registration**: YAML files in `config/` define parameterized email/docx templates. Each entry becomes a separate MCP tool at startup via `register_*_template_tools_from_yaml(mcp, path)`. Placeholders use Mustache syntax `{{name}}`. See `config/docx_templates.yaml` for the canonical example.
  - **Merged loading**: the master `config/<kind>_templates.yaml` is merged with UI-managed per-template files in `config/<kind>_templates.d/<name>.yaml` (the `.d` file wins on a name clash). The documented master files are never rewritten by tooling. Merge logic lives in `template_registry.py`.
  - **Live (un)registration**: `register_docx_template` / `register_email_template` (and their `unregister_*` counterparts) can add/replace/remove tools on a running `FastMCP` instance via `local_provider`, so the admin UI applies template edits without a restart. A module-level registry tracks live dynamic tool names.
- **Admin UI** (`admin/`, opt-in via `ADMIN_ENABLED`): a FastHTML template-admin for creating/editing dynamic docx+email templates without YAML. When enabled, `main.py` runs the **combined ASGI app** (`admin.app.build_combined_app`) under uvicorn — the MCP endpoint mounted at `/` and the admin UI under `ADMIN_PATH` (default `/admin`) in one process, so saving a template registers its MCP tool live. Modules: `store.py` (`TemplateStore` + `FileTemplateStore`, abstracted for a future shared backend), `analysis.py` (placeholder/conditional/style detection on uploaded assets), `preview.py` (render with sample values, no upload backend), `auth.py` (shared-password gate), `app.py` (views + app factory, including the Status page and document re-upload/re-scan). When `ADMIN_ENABLED` is unset, `main.py` keeps the original `mcp.run()` path unchanged.
- **Metrics** (`metrics.py`, project root): tiny always-on in-process counters (per-template calls/errors/last-used, recorded by the dynamic tool wrappers) plus a bounded recent-log ring buffer (installed by the admin app at startup). Surfaced on the admin Status page. No external deps; safe to import from the core tool modules.
- **Pydantic models** for tool arguments are created dynamically with `create_model()` in `dynamic_*_tools.py`. The `TYPE_MAP` dict maps YAML type strings to Python types.
- **Error handling in tools**: raise `fastmcp.exceptions.ToolError` for user-facing errors; use `RuntimeError` in upload/backend layers.
- **Logging**: use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` everywhere. Level controlled by `DEBUG` env var only.

## XLSX-Specific Conventions

- **Formula recalculation** (`xlsx_tools/formula_engine.py` + `xlsx_tools/xml_cache.py`): on by default (`XLSX_RECALC_ENABLED=true`). The `formulas` library is pure-Python — no LibreOffice or external binary is required. Cached values are injected directly into the worksheet XML by replacing empty `<v>` tags inside formula `<c>` cells. Recalculation runs in a worker thread bounded by `XLSX_RECALC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 30s); on timeout the file is delivered without cached values. There is no `recalc` tool argument — behavior is driven entirely by server-side ENV vars.
- **Formula error policy**: controlled by `XLSX_RECALC_STRICT` (default `false`). When `true`, any formula errors detected during recalculation (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.) or circular references (#CIRC!) cause the tool call to fail with a descriptive error so the caller can fix the formulas and retry. When `false` (default), errors are logged but the file is still delivered — misconfiguration must never block document generation. Errors are grouped by type with counts and locations, prefixed with `N/total` (error count over total formula count), in the message (`_format_grouped_errors(total_formulas=...)` in `base_xlsx_tool.py`).
- **External-link isolation** (`_blank_external_link_formulas()` in `formula_engine.py`): the `formulas` library aborts the entire workbook with `FormulaError` when it encounters an external-workbook reference (`=[Other.xlsx]Sheet1!A1`). A pre-scan detects those cells via `_EXTERNAL_LINK_RE`, blanks them in the temp copy handed to the engine (the user's file is untouched), and logs which cells were skipped. This keeps a single unsupported cell from suppressing cached values for every other formula. Excel evaluates external links natively on open, so the delivered file still works.
- **Circular-reference detection** (`detect_circular_references()` in `formula_engine.py`): the `formulas` library silently resolves cycles to nothing (no cached values, no errors), so an independent DFS-based graph analysis runs on the formula strings themselves. Every cell on a cycle is reported as a `#CIRC!` error (the `CIRCULAR_ERROR_TYPE` constant — deliberately distinct from the seven OOXML sentinels). Runs even when the recalc engine is unavailable. Reference parsing in `extract_formula_references()` is robust against false positives: string literals are stripped first via `_strip_string_literals()` (so `="see A1"` doesn't produce a phantom `A1` ref), extracted coords are validated by `_is_valid_coord()` (drops 4-letter columns and out-of-range rows), and cross-sheet refs, ranges (expanded via `_expand_range()`), 3D refs (`Sheet1:Sheet3!A1`), and absolute (`$A$1`) notation are all handled.
- **String-result formula caching**: string results (from `=A1&" total"`, `=IF(...)`, `=VLOOKUP()` returning text, etc.) ARE cached via OOXML inline-string cells (`t="str"`) — no shared-strings-table edit needed. `_format_value_for_xml()` in `xml_cache.py` returns `("value", "str")` for strings. All result types (numeric/bool/datetime/string) are cached.
- **RecalcResult** (`formula_engine.py`) carries `values_map`, `errors`, `total_formulas`, `recalc_performed`, `skip_reason`. `total_formulas` is populated from `count_formulas()` in `xml_cache.py` (counts `<f>` elements) and surfaced in error messages as `N/total`. `values_map` is filtered to formula cells only via `_collect_formula_cells()` (the engine's solution dict includes input cells too; we exclude them so the `N/M formulas cached` log is accurate and we don't do 5x the necessary work).
- **Number-format variants** (`helpers.py`): `NUMBER_FORMAT_VARIANTS`, `PERCENT_FORMAT_VARIANTS`, and `MULTIPLES_FORMAT_VARIANTS` dicts map variant keywords (`dash`, `parens`) to Excel format strings. The `multiple` type renders valuation multiples as `12.5x` (value stored raw, `x` is display only). `number:multiple` and `number:multiples` are accepted as aliases for `multiple` (users naturally write `number:multiple` expecting "number formatted as a multiple"; without the alias the value would stay as the raw text `'12.5x'` and break formulas). The default `percent` format is `0.0%` (one decimal) — use `percent:integer` for the old no-decimal `0%`.
- **Markdown directives** are parsed by `xlsx_tools/parser.py` as `<!-- key: value -->` lines above a table. Currently supported: `freeze`, `types`, `sources`. The directive parser is generic — any new directive key is automatically captured and forwarded to `add_table_to_sheet`'s `directives` dict. Directives **carry forward across `## Sheet:` headers** — a directive at the top of the markdown applies to the first table below it even if a sheet header intervenes. Directives are cleared after each table, so they never leak to tables on later sheets.
- **Sources directive precedence**: `parse_sources_directive()` processes range entries before single-cell entries, so a single-cell source (`B2=specific`) always overrides a range that covers the same cell (`B2:B5=range`), regardless of declaration order.
- **Default font** (`XLSX_DEFAULT_FONT` env var / `default_font` parameter): optional font family applied to every cell. Inline `code` formatting (Courier New) always overrides it.
- **Docker base image** is `python:3.12-slim` (not alpine) because `formulas` pulls in numpy/scipy, which only have pre-built wheels for glibc. On slim the wheels install directly with no build tools; on alpine they'd need ~400MB of build deps.

## Adding a New Document Tool

1. Create `<type>_tools/` package with `__init__.py`, `base_<type>_tool.py`, and optional `helpers.py`.
2. The base tool function should: accept content → produce an `io.BytesIO` → call `upload_file(buffer, "<ext>")` → return the result string.
3. Register the async wrapper in `main.py` using `@mcp.tool(name=..., description=..., tags=..., annotations=...)`.
4. Use `Annotated[<type>, Field(description=...)]` for all tool parameters — the descriptions are critical because MCP clients (AI models) rely on them.

## Tests

```bash
pytest                        # Run all tests (asyncio_mode=auto in pytest.ini)
pytest tests/test_docx_base.py  # Single module
```

- Tests live in `tests/` and output generated files to `tests/output/{docx,pptx,xlsx}/` for manual inspection.
- Upload is mocked in tests — patch `upload_file` or the specific `*_tool.upload_file` to capture bytes without needing a real backend. See `test_xlsx_creation.py::_create_workbook_from_markdown` for the pattern.
- PPTX tests instantiate `PowerpointPresentation` directly and call `.save()` to get a buffer, bypassing upload entirely.
- No `.env` required for tests — `config.py` defaults to `LOCAL` strategy and INFO logging.
