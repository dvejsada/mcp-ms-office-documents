# MCP MS Office Documents Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that empowers AI assistants to create professional Microsoft Office documents on your behalf.

## üöÄ What You Can Do

Transform your conversations with AI into professional documents:

- **üìä PowerPoint Presentations** - Create professional slideshows with title slides, section dividers, and content slides featuring bullet points and proper formatting
- **üìÑ Word Documents** - Generate formatted documents from markdown including headers, tables, lists, and styling - perfect for reports, contracts, and documentation  
- **üìß Email Drafts** - Compose professional email drafts in EML format with proper HTML formatting and styling
- **üìà Excel Spreadsheets** - Build data-rich spreadsheets from markdown tables with formula support and cross-table references

All documents are created with professional templates and can be customized with your own branding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup

### 1. Run the Container

Using Docker Compose (recommended):

```bash
# Download the docker-compose.yml file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvejsada/mcp-ms-office-documents/main/docker-compose.yml

# Edit the environment variables (see configuration below)
nano docker-compose.yml

# Start the server
docker-compose up -d
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8958`

### 2. Configure File Upload Strategy

Choose how generated files are delivered to you by setting the `UPLOAD_STRATEGY` environment variable:

**Option A: Local Files** (files saved to your computer)
```yaml
environment:
  UPLOAD_STRATEGY: LOCAL
volumes:
  - ./output:/app/output  # Files will be saved here
```

**Option B: AWS S3** (files uploaded to cloud storage)
```yaml
environment:
  UPLOAD_STRATEGY: S3
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY: your_access_key
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: your_secret_key  
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  S3_BUCKET: your-bucket-name
```

## üîó Connect to MCP Clients

### LibreChat

Add this configuration to your `librechat.yaml` file:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  office-docs:
    type: sse
    url: http://localhost:8958/sse  # Adjust URL if running on different host
    timeout: 120000  # Allow extra time for document generation
```

After updating the configuration:
1. Restart LibreChat
2. Create a new agent or edit an existing one
3. Add the MCP Office Documents tools to your agent
4. Start creating documents by asking your agent!

### Claude Desktop

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "office-docs": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["-e", "require('http').get('http://localhost:8958/sse')"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

The server exposes an SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint at `/sse` and follows the standard MCP protocol. Consult your MCP client's documentation for connection details.
