"""Pure-Python Excel formula evaluation via the `formulas` library.

This module isolates the third-party `formulas` library behind a small,
typed interface so that:

- callers (``xlsx_tools.base_xlsx_tool``) never import ``formulas`` directly,
- the import is lazy (only paid when recalculation is actually requested),
- the library's quirks (filename-scoped keys, numpy-array values, tqdm
  progress bars on stderr) are absorbed here rather than leaking out.

Nothing in this module shells out to an external binary. The `formulas`
library is pure Python and EUPL-1.1+ licensed, which is compatible with
the MIT license of this server.

# ── Circular-reference detection ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The `formulas` library silently resolves circular references to nothing
# (0 cached values, 0 errors) rather than flagging them. Excel itself
# shows a warning dialog and a 0 result. To catch this class of bug at
# generation time — financial models must contain no unintended circular
# references — we build a dependency graph from the formula
# strings and run a DFS cycle detection. Any cell on a cycle is reported
# as a synthetic "#CIRC!" error (not an OOXML sentinel; our own marker)
# so it surfaces through the existing error-reporting policy.

# Synthetic error type for circular references. Deliberately distinct from
# the seven OOXML sentinels in EXCEL_ERRORS so callers can tell that this
# was detected by our graph analysis, not by the recalc engine.
CIRCULAR_ERROR_TYPE = "#CIRC!"


# Parse cell references out of a formula string. Handles:
#   - Cross-sheet:  Sheet1!A1, 'Sheet 1'!A1, [Book.xlsx]Sheet1!A1
#   - Local:        A1, $A$1
#   - Ranges:       A1:B5 (expanded to individual cells), Sheet!A1:B5
# We deliberately keep this regex-based rather than using a full formula
# parser — we only need the references, not the AST, and false positives
# (e.g. a literal string "A1" inside a formula) are tolerable for
# cycle detection because they'd only produce a spurious edge, not a
# missed cycle.
